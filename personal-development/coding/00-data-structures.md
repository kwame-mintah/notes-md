# Data Structures

There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types. Data structures are like different ways of arranging and storing information in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.  Below are the 8 most common types.

## Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Java example:
```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
```

Python example:
```python
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

```java
LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();
cars.add("Volvo");
cars.add("BMW");
cars.add("Ford");
cars.add("Mazda");
```

Python example:
```python
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```
