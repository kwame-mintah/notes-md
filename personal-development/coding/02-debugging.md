# Debugging

Debugging is the process of inspecting code to resolve bugs, which can prevent software from functioning correctly. Testing is evaluating the product to make sure it functions as intended.

## Debugging Strategies

Debugging is an essential part of the development process. It involves identifying and fixing errors, also known as "bugs". There are several strategies that can be used to debug code effectively.

### Understand the problem

Before debugging, understand the problem clearly. Identify the expected behavior, the input, and the output of the code. If possible run some test cases to see how the code fails.

### Use a systematic approach

Don't randomly change the code or guess the solution. Use a systematic approach to debug the code. Depending on the language and the environment, use tools like print statements, breakpoints, debuggers, or unit tests to trace the execution of the code and find the source of the error.

### Fix the bug and verify the solution

Once the issue has been identified, fix it with the minimal and correct changes. Don't introduce new errors or modify unrelated parts of the code.

### Learn from the bug

Debugging is not only about fixing the bug, but also about learning from it. After debugging the code, reflect on what caused the bug and how it could be prevented in the future. Was it a typo, a misunderstanding, or a wrong assumption? How can you improve the coding style, testing strategy, or documentation?

> [!NOTE]
>
> - **Reproduce the error**: The first step in debugging is to try to reproduce the error.
> - **Identify the error**: Once error has been reproduced, try to identify the type of error it is. Semantic errors are caused by incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings of how a program should behave.
> - **Isolate the error**: After identifying the error, try to isolate it to a specific section of the code. This will help with focusing on the relevant parts of the code and reduce the search space for the bug.
> - **Test and debug**: Once the error has been have isolated, start testing and debugging.
