# Layout for idea write ups

Writing down my ideas takes a long time, because I have trouble laying out what needs to be included. There is so many aspects that come to mind during the write up of my ideas. I believe there is a difference between thinking of something and then documenting this idea.

I understand that an idea doesn't need to go into too much detail, however I find myself adding more details as I write. I have tried to create a template ([[00-idea-template]]) for my ideas and use the headings to be give me help with what I need to include. Below are some interesting difference I have found between some headings.

## Introduction vs Background

I have always started with the 'Background', to explain how the idea come to mind and to provide context. It's important as it contains details as to why the idea is necessary and explains what it it is trying to resolve.

However, 'Introductions' talks about the idea itself (_?_). The introduction is supposed to give the reader and idea of what they are about to read and also summaries the 'Background' section. From reading the introduction alone, the reader is supposed to have good understanding of what they are about to read and what to expect in each section.

The 'Introduction' and 'Background' are not interchangeable as I had originally thought. Although, they both have the same concept, the are different and important sections to include. While both the 'Introduction' and the 'Background' might talk about similar things on the report itself, the 'Introduction' is exclusively about the paper itself [^1].

## Abstract vs Summary

A 'Summary' is a section I always include in every document I have written. And it has been used to provide restatements of the main points made throughout but in a concise manner at the end.

On the other hand, an 'Abstract' is a brief summary of a research paper or article. It is usually a standalone piece of writing that provides an overview of the entire content, without going into too much details. The 'Abstract' section is commonly found in academic and scientific writing. However, I believe it would be beneficial to include when writing my idea.

'Abstract' and 'Summary' are not interchangeable, they might both serve the same purposes. But an 'Abstract' is a brief summary of an entire research paper or article, while a 'Summary' is a condensed version of a specific section or piece of content[^2].

## Elevator pitch

The elevator pitch is something I have come across before, but did not think about too much when writing my ideas. An elevator pitch is supposed to be short description of an idea, product, or company that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time [^3].

This is the main reason, I would like to include an 'Abstract' section in my layout as the abstract is supposed to be 100 - 300 words, which can be linked with an elevator pitch not needing to include all components, but at least explain what the idea, product, company, or person is and value.
