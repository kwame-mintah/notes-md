# Food for thought

Interesting things that I have come across and are worth remembering.

## The CIA model: Control, Influence, Accept

The Critically Reflective Practitioner (2008) is a framework for navigating difficult times or situations. We use this model often in communications and leadership training. Sometimes used as a stress-management tool, the **model helps bring focus and clarity on actions to take, and guides us how to minimise the impact of external events at the same time as maximising the impact of our personal power**[^1].

## The X-Y Problem

The X-Y Problem, as it is sometimes called, occurs when a person tries to solve a problem on their own, pursues a method that seems like a promising approach, gets stuck, and then asks for help with their chosen method (instead of asking for help with the original problem).

In reality, the method on which they got stuck may be the longest/most complicated route to the answer. **The best way to solve the problem is to start over.**

In other words:

- User wants to do X.
- User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
- User doesn't know how to do Y either.
- User asks for help with Y.
- Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
- After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y was a dead end.

The reason people get their train of thought stuck on one approach is that they've forgotten how much they rely on trial and error problem solving shortcuts so they're valuing a potential dead end just as if it were a proven thing. Remaining open to having a new look at the bigger picture, might help such people to accept just being handed the solution to X instead, be directed to alternatives which might be more practical by far, or being assured that the particular approach they've been working on doing is unsuitable [^2].
