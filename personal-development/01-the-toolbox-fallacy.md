# The Toolbox Fallacy

The Toolbox Fallacy is **a self-deception where people believe that they can't do something until they have certain tools in their toolbox**. This belief is often disguised as excuses or a lack of "tools". The problem is that once the tools arrive, it's too easy to continue down the slippery slope of toolbox logic.[^1] The Toolbox Fallacy is a common excuse for not doing things, such as not having the right materials or studying art. The longer we go without dropping the next marker in the stream of time, the less meaningful that marker becomes.[^2]

> I can’t do X until I have Y. Once I have the (gym membership, tablet, camera, laptop, time), then I’ll be able to (workout, paint more, work on my photography, write, be happy.) That is the Toolbox Fallacy, […](https://youtu.be/sz4YqwH_6D0?feature=shared&t=165)

## Overcoming the Fallacy

This notion of not being able accomplish X, without Y had been my thought process for a long time until I saw a video by [Passion of the nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YqwH_6D0) years ago. I had originally watched the video due to the thumbnail being a scene from the movie [Collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(film)) and I am glad I did as it made me aware of what I had been doing unconsciously.

Before I picked up programming, I wanted to get into user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. I thought I couldn't do it without a Macbook and once I have it, I can start. But after I made the purchase, not much happened... I just kept waiting for the next thing to happen.. until I buy Sketch, until I understand human-centric design, until.. etc.

It will come to a point, were you realise you're just lying to yourself. And I found myself using the same fallacy over and over again. Once I had gotten the Macbook, I barely used it and when I did, it wasn't for what it was intended. Having a Macbook doesn't make you UI/UX designer, you don't even need that specific hardware to be able to create these designs.

The creation of the UI and the interaction between the end users is what makes you a UI/UX designer. The real problem was that I was afraid to make mistakes. I wanted my first project to be _perfect_, so I could share it with everyone.

> Much of my life has been dedicated to learning how to manage my own fear of failing, and I have only ever found two things that work for me.
> The first is to EXPECT failure’s inevitable visitation from time to time, as opposed to fearing it.
> The second is to remind myself as necessary, that a lifetime spent failing would still be a life better lived than the one in which I never got started. [...](https://youtu.be/sz4YqwH_6D0?feature=shared&t=314)

I needed to accept, that my first project wouldn't be perfect, but what was important is that I had tried because at that time, I had nothing to show and had made no mistakes that I could make improvements. Ever since, I have always attempted to try something new and accepted that it won't be perfect but I would have at least $done$ [it]([[[[00-the-cult-of-done-manifesto]]).

> “I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough, we must do.” - Leonardo da Vinci 

At the end of the day, it's better to say you have tried or at least attempted something. Rather than not making any attempts at all.
