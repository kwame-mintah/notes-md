## Supervised learning

Within supervised learning, you have different types of problems. These can be broadly categorised into two categories: classification and regression.

### Linear Learner

Can also be used for both classification and regression, The difference is that you set the hyperparameters ([[06-feature-engineering]]) to direct these algorithms to produce quantitative results.

### XGBoost

Can also be used for both classification and regression, The difference is that you set the hyperparameters ([[06-feature-engineering]]) to direct these algorithms to produce quantitative results.

### DeepAR

### K-Nearest Neighbors

TBA.

## Natural language processing (NLP)

### BlazingText

BlazingText algorithm provides highly optimised implementations of the Word2vec and text classification algorithms.

### Sequence2sequence (Seq-2-Seq)

Sequence2sequence is a supervised learning algorithm where the input is a sequence of tokens (for example, text, audio) and the output generated is another sequence of tokens.

### Object2Vec

Object2Vec generalises the well-known Word2Vec embedding technique for words that are optimised in the Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm.

## Computer Vision

### Image classification

Image classification is a supervised learning algorithm used to classify images.

### Object detection

Object detection algorithm detects and classifies objects in images using a single deep neural network. It is a supervised learning algorithm that takes images as input and identifies all instances of objects within the image scene. The object is categorized into one of the classes in a specified collection with a confidence score that it belongs to the class. Its location and scale in the image are indicated by a rectangular bounding box.

### Semantic segmentation

Semantic segmentation algorithm tags every pixel in an image with a class label from a predefined set of classes.

Instance segmentation detects and delineates each distinct object of interest appearing in an image. It tags every pixel with an instance label. Whereas semantic segmentation assigns the same tag to pixels of multiple objects of the same class, instance segmentation further labels pixels corresponding to each occurrence of an object on the image with a separate tag.
