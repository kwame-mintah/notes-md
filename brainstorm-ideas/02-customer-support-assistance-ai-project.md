# Customer support assistance AI project

## Background

As a firm believer that artificial intelligence (AI) will aid people in becoming more efficient at work and should be seen as improvement. One industry I have found that would benefit significantly from using AI is the customer support industry.

Working within customer support, employees have to deal with numerous customers, enquiring about different things. Often, you would find that there are departments that handle certain cases and will need to be transferred.

## Context

When calling a customer support hotline, information needs to provided to ensure you are connected to the correct person who can help with your inquiry. If the person you connected with is unable to assist you, they will transfer the call to someone who can help.

Too often, you will find the need to repeat the same information to this person, before they can proceed further.

## Case in point

I have had to phone customer support in the past to help with a request. And found myself having to give the same information, to several people and left me confused because this information wasn't being passed across. This resulted in frustration as it meant that the issue was not being resolved and rather being prolonged.

And in some cases, I will have to wait for a call from someone else who can assist and hope the information captured is correct.

## Idea

The idea is to use AI, to listen into customer phone calls and actively take notes to assist the employee handling the request. This could be in the form of helping the employee navigate through their in-house application to find the necessary information, which will result with helping resolve the customer request quicker.

Rather than, "can you please hold while I pull up your file..." the information would have already been presented to the employee and allow them to continue with assisting the customer and remove the wait in between trying to find certain information.

Ideally, the AI would be populating the correct fields that the employee can see on their screen, for example the customer might need to provide their first and last name in order to find their account. The solution would understand the key information that the customer has provided and pre-populate these fields.

This will benefit both the customer and the employee as they will be able to resolve requests much quicker and if the call needs to be forwarded to another person, all information has already been captured and there isn't too much of a reliance on the person handling the call to complete any forms during the call.

As there is now a transcript of the call between the customer and the employee, if the case needs to be looked at in the future, everything would have been captured and a summary could be provided.
